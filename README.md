Predicting what type of customers are leaving the bank organization.
And what are the important attributes that are creating a churn(person) to leave the bank.

In this problem i used normal supervised machine learning algorithms for making prediction and also 
used  ANN(artificial neural network for predicting).I found that ANN giving best accuracy prediction than normal 
machine learning algorithms.

So in these problem at the end i predicted the results of test case. I prepared plots of customers who are leaving the 
bank from the predictions made.The best accuracy i got is(0.85) and i am still working to bring more accuracy.
